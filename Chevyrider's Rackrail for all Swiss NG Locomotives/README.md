[Release] Rackrail for all Swiss NG Loks.
I altered all narrow gauge loks, so that they all can make use of the rackrail.
Also changed the horsepower and speeds to a higher range and according the release date.
The cargo wagons have also a higher speed and can load 25 tonnes.
This because the very high running costs on long distances.
Must be more profitable now.
Faster passenger carriages with also higher speed.
Have fun.
