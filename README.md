# Chris-Sawyers-Locomotion-Mods-Collection
Misc collection of various mods downloaded from tt-forums.net over the years.
I had trouble trying to find some of these old mods again a few years ago the last time I went to play this game, so I thought reupload the ones I have from an old backup.

All mods belong to their original authors, I claim no ownership. If you do own one of these mods, find it here and would like me to remove it then please feel free to ask. These were reuploaded here for archival/convenience purposes only. There's been so many great locomotion/ttd sites & mods that have disappeared into the ether, just lost to time over the years. It'd be a shame to lose more of it.

Useful locomotion links;

https://www.locomotiondepot.net/ -Owens locomotion depot

https://www.walter1940.de -Walters mods collection

https://locomotion.abfahrtstafel.de/ -Random german site

https://cache.locomotiondepot.net/index.php -Steves locomotion cache

https://www.tt-forums.net/ -Scroll down for locomotion sections (a lot of the mods in this github were originally from here)


P.s. Please add to this if you can. If you have any mod i dont have here or one you know you can no longer find elsewhere online, it'd be great if you could share it again here. :)
