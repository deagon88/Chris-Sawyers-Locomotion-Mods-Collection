Plastikman's Autoplant Mod 2.6 Final (I Hope)

**********************
NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
**********************

If You are upgrading from a previous Beta, (2.4a and earlier) Your old scenerios and old save games WILL NOT work as expected. Old save games WILL HAVE a bug where the auto parts factory will output insane amounts scrap metal for no reason at all. All old secenrarios WILL HAVE the same bug. To make Old Scenerios work right, You  have to load them in the scenerio editor, REMOVE ALL the AUTO PARTS PLANTS and replace them with NEW AUTO PARTS PLANTS (the same building). Silly, yes I know, it seems that once a building is placed on the map, the code is set to the scenario, NOT the building. Therefore The scenario will still use the old code.

2.5 only lasted 2 days? I found a huge bug in it. I relesed a Beta Version of the Auto Parts Factory. It was not making ANY Scrap at all. This new version Seems very stable I have been playing it for 8 hours now and decided to update it. Just intall and play. If You are Upgrading from 2.5, unstarted scenarios are ok. If you are playing 2.5 savegames, You have nothing to worry about, Just keep playing, it is self healing. The factories will work as planed once they recive a load of plastic and a load of steel in the same month You will get scrap. 

Sorry for that.
Plastik.

* Note, the city builds and destroys auto dealers as the city grows, have fun finding them! Also, the Computer Player AI (and Yourself) Can destroy them while building in town. You can place Auto Dealers when making a scenerio. Once a city hits size 4?  (I forget the number I coded this over a year ago) it starts making auto dealers.it us coded like a park for when to start bulding both large and small.


Item ID Numbers for this beta:

Use these to make vechicals to haul the items.
Autos  		48 (i used 17 from Fultrons Mod, changed because it is also the item for wood chips in the enhanced paper mod I dont know if 48 is used in any other mod. 17 is still autos in Fultron's mod)
Plastic 	21 (from Fultrons Great Lakes mod)
Scrap 		22 (from Fultrons Great Lakes mod)

name="AUTOPRTS"  47
name="PLASTIC "  21
name="AUTOS   "  48
name="SCRAP   "  22

Possible things to do still. Add "junked cars" from auto dealers that can be sold at a junkyard
have the junkyard make steel and plastic pellets (more like a recycling center)
fix the bug with the auto parts factory so it makes scarp agian. (has to be rebuilt from the ground up, I really messed the xml up) **FIXED**
Add More new graphics


Credits:
uhh myself for building this and the coding along with shawn4186 that made many of the buildings, the scrapyard and the autoplant for Me. His help helped me figgure out what the hell the building XMLS do, the coding and how to replace the building graphics (LoL now that i forgot, a year later,
 lot of good it did me...)
Fultron for his great lakes mod that i swiped bits from (the object dats) and code samples.
The many beta testers.. 
Busman for the motivation to dig it up again and finnish this and some beta testing
PennCentral for the Scenraio, This is a rework based on his western ohio fun1 map.




Changelog...
