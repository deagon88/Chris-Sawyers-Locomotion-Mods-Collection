 Thanks to: Owen Rudge for www.tt-forums.net for giving us a place to brainstorm and allow us to create sets like this one. Thanks to  Patchman for Locotool. Thanks to MajorDuck and Andel For the inspiration to start building Locomotion sets. Thanks to, busman, Justin Cornell,  Matt and others for keeping me on track, beta testing and all of the ideas. Thanks to Juan Valdez for picking my coffee beans so I can function. Thanks to Microsoft and Kuji for making MSTS. Thanks to Chris Sawyer for locomotion (may one day he get paid). All the beta testers that made my life a little easier. thanks to the MSTS community that if did not exist, neither would this pack.everyone else for being patient while i build these set ever so slowly, I rather take My time and be happy with the end product. Using just msts2loco just is not enough, period. as nice of a tool as it is, it is just NOT the way to do conversions. I have gotten to the point that I wont use anything that is not HQ conversion or 3D modeled in Locomotion anymore.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Last but not least: ENJOY this set. I worked hard to bring it to you, The modelers worked hard on the models. I enjoyed making it (mostly) and I enjoy playing with it (totally). 

I do this for My own use and go the extra mile to share it with you. Please feel free to post your comments on the tt-forums and post screen shots of this set in action! I want your feedback good or bad. What you say influences future sets!

please post any Comments, Bug reports found on tt-fourms and I will address them ASAP. I try to take pride in my conversions.

Please, Donate to AMI and TT-Forums, And if you have MSTS, Buy the Dekosoft sets. If it was not for them, This set would not exist.
